# HashTableProblems

UC1 - Ability to find frequency of words in a sentence like “To be or not to be”
- Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation
- To do this we create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode

UC2 - Ability to find frequency of words in a large paragraph phrase 
“Paranoids are not paranoid because they are paranoid but because they keep putting themselves deliberately into paranoid avoidable situations”
- Use hashcode to find index of the words in the para
- Create LinkedList for each index and store the words and its frequency
- Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation
- To do this create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode

UC3 - Remove avoidable word from the phrase “Paranoids are not paranoid because they are paranoid but
because they keep putting themselves deliberately into paranoid avoidable situations”
- Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation like here the removal of word avoidable
- To do this create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode
